Market basket analysis is a statistical technique used to identify associations between products that are frequently purchased together by customers. It is also known as affinity analysis or association rule mining.

Market basket analysis works by analyzing transaction data from a store or website to determine which items are frequently purchased together. The analysis identifies the products that tend to be bought together and the frequency of their co-occurrence in the same transaction.

This information is then used to generate rules or associations between products that can be used to optimize product placement and promotion, make recommendations to customers, or design marketing campaigns.

Market basket analysis is widely used in retail, e-commerce, and other industries to better understand customer behavior and improve sales and marketing strategies.
